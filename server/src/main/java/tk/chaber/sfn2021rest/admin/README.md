## About complexity of admin management implementation 
I, Oskar Habraszewski - backend developer of Diving, know it really well, that this system is very primitive
and is not sustainable for its purpose. If I would develop any real app I would definitely spend more time on such a system.
It was not required in this project - we would be fine without admin management system, but I decided to make it to make our life easier.
Since I had no much time before release I've done it as it is.

I just wanted to write this so that anybody reading that code would know, that I'm not that dumb to create a serious admin management system this way :-) *

*- It's also nice easter egg in GitHub repository
