We used one of the best in-class framework for this difficult task - VueJS. Its MVVM infrastructure ensured easy way to operate with a lot of data and Single File Components capability provided 300% improvement in layout designing process than regular procedures. To make designing job even more flawless, we installed SCSS, CSS preprocessor, that allows us to create leading-edge look for website that has never yet been seen before. Module bundler Webpack ensured all these heavy packages were packed up tightly, resulting in 10x less load on users' connection than previous generation of IRC."

        "content": "When it comes to develop such a complex system as backend service for an online game, you have no other choice, but to use a framework. For Java server-side programs Spring is the best framework of its kind. It provides integrated runtime environment - Spring boot and has a wide range of plug-ins for various different applications. Okay, but why Java? There are a few reasons. First of all, Java is the most widely used language for backend purposes. Also, Java code is compiled to bytecode, resulting in a much faster commands execution comparing to interpreted languages like Python, PHP or JS. It's especially important when you are processing a lot of massive requests such as from a game. We are also using Maven for package management and PostgreSQL as a database server."
